Welcome to the Health Literacy Center of Nashville,

Only an estimated 12% of the adult population in America has proficient health literacy (HL). Studies suggest early medical interventions are more likely to improve HL and outcomes rather than interventions that take place later in life. Understanding medical direction from a Primary Care Physician (PCP) and other healthcare professionals is critical for patients to succeed. However distrust of the white coat and apprehension to medical advice is apparent based on racial and socioeconomic factors, especially concerning the medical field’s history of exploitation.  

Research has shown patients who engage their PCP are more likely to experience better health outcomes, and report less spending on healthcare expenses. This is especially applicable to adolescents in a transitional period of life, most of which have likely not visited their doctor alone. Prior studies show that adolescents with higher HL reported better health outcomes. 

The Health Literacy Center of Nashville (HLC) builds trust between the public and healthcare professionals by breaking down the stigma of the patient/doctor relationship. Medical students located in Nashville, TN are recruited to work with adolescents to discuss prevalent health risks, how to engage their PCP and learn how to ask proper questions to get the most out of each doctor’s visit in a more informal manner. This interaction is beneficial to both participants; adolescents learn communication skills they carry into adulthood and the medical students engage in patient interactions early in their pursuits. 

The ultimate objective of HLC is to create a more engaged patient community and build trust between healthcare professionals and their patients. Patient communication and empowerment is pivotal in order to achieve health equity, and health literacy is a tool that can be used to fight social determinants of health and build a healthier generation.
