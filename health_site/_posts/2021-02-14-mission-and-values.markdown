<h2>Mission Statement</h2>

The Health Literacy Center of Nashville provides equitable patient advocacy skills to the greater Nashville youth community by eliminating the confusion and intimidation of speaking to a doctor. Creating a generation of inquisitive and confident patients will lead to better interactions between patients and physicians; ultimately addressing medical needs and providing preventative care. This results in reduced cost of healthcare and decreased disparities in preventable disease.
