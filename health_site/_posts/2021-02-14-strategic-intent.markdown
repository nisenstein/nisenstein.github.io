HLC addresses disparities in health literacy on 3 levels:
 <li>Physician-to-Patient communication</li>
 <li>Patient-to-Physician communication</li>
 <li>Physician-to-Physician communication</li>
<br>
This is wholly different than most HL tools, which focus primarily on Physician-to-Patient communication. 

<h2>Physician-to-patient Communication</h2>

Medical students who participate with HLC increase interactions with populations they intend to serve. Many of these students are interested in pediatrics, and are excited to be able to impart their knowledge to willing participants. The program is available to first and second year medical students who are eager to improve their own professional communication skills. Medical students will be allowed to teach based on interest and availability for the organization. Participants fill out post lesson surveys to comment on both the lesson and their interaction with the medical students. 

<h2>Patient-to-Physician communication</h2>

The communication lessons implemented at HLC are modeled from the University of British Columbia’s “Talk To Your Doc” program, which connects medical students to adolescents to learn how to effectively interact with healthcare professionals.7 Through this method, adolescents become more aware of what to expect from their physicians and learn how to communicate their needs effectively. 

<h2>Physician-to-Physician Communication</h2>

Nashville stands out with 5 major hospital systems and 2 nationally recognized medical institutions. HLC operates independently to provide a community for Nashville’s aspiring healthcare professionals. Interactions between students from Meharry Medical College and Vanderbilt School of Medicine encourages medical students to learn from each other and address racism in the healthcare field. Meharry and Vanderbilt serve different communities, and this is an opportunity for medical students to come together as one. Each medical student will reflect on their experiences, both individually and as a group. HLC will achieve equity in healthcare through improving patient and professional interaction.
